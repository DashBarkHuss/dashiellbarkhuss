            <p>The human brain likes to pick the easy, comfortable path. 
                Unfortunately, this path often leads to poor outcomes and 
                at best a mediocre life. The paths that provide the most 
                growth are uncomfortable. </p>
            <p>With this challenge, our goal is to train our brain out of 
                choosing the easy path. Choosing discomfort will become our 
                new default. We will become comfortable with discomfort.</p>
             
            <p>Practicing discomfort in benign situations will strengthen 
                our tolerance for discomfort. So that when we’re faced with 
                a difficult decision in the future, discomfort is not a 
                barrier to our decisions.</p>
            <h2>Rules</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Do (at least) one thing every day for 30 days that 
                    challenges your comfort zone.</li>
                <li>Don’t tell people you’re doing the challenge in order 
                    to relieve the pressure of one of your challenges. For 
                    example, if your challenge is to wear an embarrassing 
                    shirt, don’t tell people you’re wearing it for the 
                    challenge as this relieves most of the discomfort and 
                    defeats the purpose. Use your judgement to decide when 
                    it’s appropriate to mention the challenge.
                </li>
                <li>If your challenges involves other people, it should be 
                    more uncomfortable for you than those around you. You should 
                    be in the vulnerable position not the other person.</li>
                <li>
                        Do not skip days.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You can break any of the rules to suite your needs. 
                    But make sure you’re breaking them for the right reasons. 
                    I’d recommend you set rules before you start and stick to them.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
            Discomfort is nothing to be afraid of. We’re not talking about pain. Just 
            a little discomfort! Make sure you’re gauging your emotional and physical 
            discomfort, picking challenges that will push you just enough. Too much 
            and you may scare yourself from choosing the uncomfortable path again. Too 
            little and you won’t gain anything.
